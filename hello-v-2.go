package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	
	fmt.Printf("Hello World! I have come to destroy you all \n")
	
}

// the format or fmt package is similar to the <stdio.h> package which imports formatted IO functions... so essentially printf(); in C - practically, this enables the developer to safely include things into strings, like %s for injecting in a string
